## Deepthi Nacharaju
HRSS.py is the server file that is running on my VM. 
main.py is the file i used to test my server that I call from my local machine

This server uses MongoDB, and SendGrid to send emails when a heart rate is Tachycardic given a patient age.


TravisCI is setup and passes all of the test_HRSS.py functions.
